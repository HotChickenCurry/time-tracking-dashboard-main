## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (fetch + DOM manipulation)


### What I learned

This project helped me practice:
- Dynamically generating cards from JSON data using fetch().
- Using Object.entries() to loop through timeframes.
- Updating the DOM when switching between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats.
- Tailwind utility classes for responsive layouts and hover effects.

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:
- Explore adding transitions/animations when switching between timeframes.
- Practice more with data-driven components instead of static HTML.
- Improve accessibility by ensuring better semantic structure and ARIA labels.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – Super helpful for styling quickly.
- [MDN Web Docs - Object.entries ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries) - Helped me loop through the JSON data effectively.
- [Screenfly](https://screenfly.org) - For testing responsiveness
